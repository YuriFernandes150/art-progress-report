# Spirik's Art Corner

This is my little art progress report readme! This is where I document my learning journey properly.

## In the Beginning... (2024)

I just bought a drawing tablet and started using Krita. Here are a few of my early pieces:

<br>
<br>
<br>

TIP: **NEVER** Zoom in too much, you will get this:
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
While still using Krita, I started using references and tried my best to adapt some sketches:
<br>

<br>
<br>
After that, I tried adding color to my drawings:
<br>

<br>
<br>
Then I bought Clip Studio Paint, and it really made a difference for me! It was so much easier to draw with. However, the drawings still weren't very good:
<br>

<img width="100" height="180" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eea58c0a-340f-4257-b3c0-a388f41c1c91" />

<br>
<br>

## The (Almost) Daily Practice Era (April 2025)

Around April, I really decided to commit to drawing. I was inspired by so many things! The first drawing I made during this period was themed around The Finals:
<br>

<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/398ddef0-2430-40c8-94da-9be16f777c91" />

This drawing was the turning point for me. After creating it, I found myself constantly thinking about and anticipating the next time I could draw.

<br>
<br>
I started researching lightly and got inspired to make a simple Sonic fan comic. Here are my first attempts at drawing an original character for the comic:
<br>

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ca6c71d-f4dc-4d6e-9e6b-2ee874907a18" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/679dddfd-8a9d-4a9c-a71a-d37710c1b9cc" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33321c69-5076-48a9-a03b-5accecde276e" />
<img width="200" height="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19791508-38c5-4c0b-b888-66fca4cd99e2" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1753a273-38e7-49fc-aa99-0f071c7fb0e0" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da8119f3-a4b0-4a23-ba58-03b1c61dc7ed" />

I love drawing this little bird, lol.

<br>
<br>
Then I started light practice around parts of the body, though I dropped it pretty quickly:
<br>

<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dca899d4-5f84-4694-abbb-3862d1f01e11" />
<br>
<br>

Next, I started to want to learn more about perspective, so I gave [Dom Ho Kim's Space Drawing Perspective](https://pt.scribd.com/document/863084480/Dong-Ho-Kim-Space-Drawing-Perspective) a read.
<br>
<br>

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89e2fca4-48ef-4bbd-8e39-9d9d28d1e2ec" />
<img width="200" height="150" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbfd4b61-3082-46d2-a612-cf69d85aa839" />

<br>
<br>

For drawing backgrounds, I also got a lot of help from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZxvrzDyRa8). Who knew that turning a layer blue made such a huge difference!
<br>

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00c83f76-eb49-4275-a0e3-9fb206b4d5d8" />

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7048cf42-4c61-4782-be52-cf9a173af145" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2335247f-f6fc-4dd2-b80c-339464de7d13" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9782b40b-571a-4413-9309-6ffc38c733ef" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0279ef8c-a183-4863-9b07-c566f1d306a9" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fa2900e-67d3-4cd6-b135-8229890f6a38" />

<br>
<br>
This is when I noticed some improvements in my linework! Look at this cute drawing! (Her name is Nova):
<br>

<img width="500" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/658fee96-47bd-4e49-a89b-78c09a1d351a" />

<br>
<br>
Then I started looking at simple expression references. You can't do a comic without cool facial expressions, right? I based myself on Sonic references. These two have been my most-used for expressions since then:
<br>

<img width="300" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/822feee2-cd1f-46b2-9c05-6b827bc7ab7a" />
<img width="300" height="150" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4041e94-4bf3-49b5-8fb4-8a67e056f58b" />

I also picked up some handy bird references for Nova. I really liked some angles for Wave in the Sonic series, so I decided to use her as a reference since I still have trouble drawing the mouth movements and expressions of characters with beaks.
<br>

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84b6d6eb-9c85-412f-8189-e290dc4bac88" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c03a1a5-310b-41c5-8173-ca394777b90d" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/974c61b8-ad83-42ff-81b6-4fc6b69a382f" />

<br>
<br>
<br>

**Quick note:** This image is hilarious and I keep laughing at it to this day:
<br>

<img width="300" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a33a986-9fd9-4976-9dc4-4e22648bbfe0" />

<br>
<br>
<br>

Anyway, here are the attempts I made using the Wave references:
<br>

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b0fd66f-6092-4316-a464-e80e64e8bddb" />
<img width="500" height="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1cd12ba-3953-401b-a2b2-4e914693dec7" />

By this point, I already noticed improvement in drawing the faces of Sonic characters:

<br>

<img width="100" height="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6aba058-464c-4cb9-b490-2874f33efcc8" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f4bf413-cfe5-4d28-91f9-896282d77bbe" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df3cc3eb-6209-410d-aa30-9eeb1bb69b4f" />

<br>

Hey, I was even able to draw two characters interacting! (Which at that point I thought would be impossible for me, lol):
<br>

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b5d8ce9-dde3-429a-9e91-d76bd4fa04ec" />

<br>

At this point, I tried drawing a goofy, expressive, and dynamic drawing. It was the first time I actually tried something like that in digital. This kind of goofy, happy, cartoony feel is what I actually want my art to be:
<br>

<img width="200" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3de9e229-e29d-45c1-81cd-e8aefd542b4b" />
<img width="200" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab34f595-11b1-4eb0-8309-9c56779c08ba" />
<img width="200" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2073c81c-e5f1-4766-a4dc-2180e0c3bdea" />

Pretty cool! I still like these drawings, even noticing the problems with them. Isn't that the best part, though? Noticing your mistakes and figuring out how to correct them next time!

<br>
<br>

What really inspired me to draw like this was [Keith Webb's](https://x.com/webbstawebb) art style:

<br>

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a7c4ec1-b9f8-492a-b415-ce0b2e7e6515" />
<img width="350" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/059b09f7-45d2-4c6a-99ee-68ecba020ac3" />

But then I realized: my shading was too weak! I wanted a cartoony style, but I also wanted to achieve nice light and shadows! This [cool video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoUA8U0xxSY) really helped me during the initial steps.

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Trying to Set Up a Schedule (May 2025)

When May arrived, I was feeling more motivated and wanted to practice seriously. So I organized an entire one-year schedule for my practice sessions:
<br>

<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c3fd327-90e3-4391-b1d2-2f7dddd6d0f3" />
<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/991ac977-1712-465c-9ca9-4c04b565e935" />
<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef524b06-9fdd-4a9a-abd6-9da0fa473e82" />
<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15da2cfe-dd8f-42e2-80ed-d1dceb1d00d2" />

I went ultra organized, but I had a lot of trouble actually following through with the schedule.
<br> But oh well!
<br>

After setting it all up, I started practicing poses and expressions for Sonic:
<br>

<img width="400" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5343fe6b-1c08-4a07-9bae-350498dba1a1" />
<img width="400" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06c389d5-78c2-48b7-96ee-b625fec728d3" />
<br>

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/968360ae-c377-49bd-b12b-01876197b3ee" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/477a092f-2625-460d-b054-60a6f01df0cb" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06ba5448-c4f7-4b5d-bd9a-cf3d16907a52" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3c9257b-a5bd-4494-a8ef-b7907a0b8023" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12fd38f7-0574-4770-86b4-01897976a88d" />

<br>
<br>

For perspective practice, I discovered that I could make rooms in perspective by creating a plane from above and stretching it across the floor! It really helped me figure things out.
<br>

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fc9c91c-d96c-4b75-86d3-de6c87afb2f2" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf870d83-15f5-4769-8e78-ac9e6acc8dd9" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c49a863-1724-4264-a155-a8adb1c88c28" />

I also did some really interesting experiments mixing perspective, posing, and other techniques:
<br>

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bedab098-291b-4be5-a12e-d1332395730d" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e183babe-1ff4-4e12-a151-a277f853249e" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f09b5aed-f267-4137-97b5-e2a2e489eee1" />

<br>
<br>

For backgrounds, I had trouble pinning down the perspective. I didn't just want to copy a background—I wanted to study it and figure it out myself!
<br>

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60839a6f-cc61-4f99-8e8a-a45ad28dd378" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11c3b1b7-5938-4430-a099-d8c3c5432f3b" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0ffa3fa-7392-4b90-9ee3-57f71d43c841" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/474c8208-2c9a-488e-9f77-1ee7a6e52e8c" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f90873a8-152d-4e5d-80f0-9fc2662a2f19" />

When I have trouble with backgrounds and finding their perspective, I refer to these three photos I took:
<br>

<img width="400" height="186" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c27b07cd-7e05-4d0c-b6ad-30d2c78d0a99" />
<img width="400" height="186" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7c57c50-4ee3-42c4-8589-1ccafa6a0d5f" />
<img width="400" height="186" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6aea6240-25e6-4c13-92b4-1abf8a02b0bf" />

These represent one-point, two-point, and three-point perspectives taken from the exact same position!

<br>
<br>

Another thing I discovered this month: **IT'S ALL BOXES! EVERYTHING FITS IN A BOX! IT'S ABSOLUTELY INSANE!**
<br>

<img width="200" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f7e501a-5748-4bfe-9f95-8ca8ebf4b802" />
<img width="200" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/394c583f-f123-4489-806f-6c575665b5d5" />

<img width="600" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/888eec82-fd63-4a7e-8936-d20eccadc5b5" />

Armed with this wisdom, I set out to try it myself:
<br>

<img width="200" height="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05241a15-666f-411f-899b-3645c43bac62" />
<img width="200" height="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20a1652d-8166-4cd9-874c-c1629ad7aa03" />

<br>
<br>

At this point, I decided to try a small change in my lineart approach. I've always loved thick lines, so I decided to give it a go:
<br>

<img width="200" height="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ed559ed-7284-4d77-b57d-f6b59be1b6c6" />

To be honest, I was really starting to like what I drew by this point. It's not nearly as professional or appealing to most people, but for me? I loved it. From then on, I really focused on thick lineart for future pieces.
<br>

<img width="300" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3863af81-7bde-4714-b82e-99ae8ca1b07d" />

I even started applying it to previous drawings:
<br>

<img width="800" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3178e6c-9835-4670-bfb1-bd156fd090db" />

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Visible Improvements (June 2025)

Here are some more practice drawings from that time. I really like how my lineart improved since the first ones!
<br>

<img width="200" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4dbd4dd-25f5-4df8-b0a4-c194ec87979a" />

At this point, I had trouble drawing the character's feet and shoes, so the boxes really helped me again! Though many failed attempts were required:
<br>

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b17bb66-ad50-4611-9899-d753d6773574" />

<br>
**And the winner is:**

After that, I made a few more drawings where the shoes and feet looked more correct:
<br>

<br>
<br>

Then I started to have fun! I made some stickers for use on Discord:
<br>

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22be80eb-1737-4b00-ad93-682b3b1a22a1" />

<br>
<br>

And because of the stickers, some people even came to me asking me to draw their OCs. I was a bit shocked, to be honest!
<br>

### Clef's OC: Ace

### Ghastly's OC: Spike

<br>
<br>
<br>

After all those fun times, I started drawing more from imagination. I made this Sonic drawing, and to be honest, I absolutely adore it to this day:
<br>

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8da74bf3-9439-4e0f-b2d2-221dd5623ccf" />

Here's another one (Boxes!):
<br>

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93db508d-a8a0-4cff-8b07-2018fb1c624c" />

<br>
<br>

I also made one of my funniest drawings at this time:
<br>

<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3efe33f2-1bd5-42ab-b5ab-7e884175877a" />

<br>
<br>

I also took this opportunity to practice shading:
<br>

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e82cdcb-d3b7-4972-89e0-132ac1d715c8" />

Not my best attempt, if I'm being honest. But hey, we learn from mistakes!

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Animation! (July 2025)

I always wanted to try animations, even if simple, so I decided to challenge myself and make a little GIF!
<br>

It all starts with the sketch. I wanted to replicate this high-five GIF:
<br>

![hippo](https://media1.tenor.com/m/otKA66ctn9YAAAAd/scout-and-jester-dap-up-scout-and-jester.gif)
<br>

Well, it was a simple enough GIF, right? Two frames and some movement! I can do it! (Right?)
<br>

<img width="200" height="350" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b6a593f-b9b4-400d-9787-83aee5230712" />
<img width="200" height="350" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aebd648d-cee3-4e3c-beb8-11fe3baa4b3f" />
<br>

Something I do a lot is fix the drawing! Holy... how many times did I have to fix to get the face right?
<br>

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df688ef0-1b62-4897-ae21-fd460fb8f7b9" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ed91b8d-5f8a-4ed6-92f5-6929a802f335" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7d0893f-abac-4ffd-a7dc-14939e24567c" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15a7642a-9a32-4e64-854a-838d86ce1bcc" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3af397e5-9cc5-45d9-8405-59eff09d5508" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60d5cf96-4164-4ead-90d9-1731aaf3a8ac" />
<br>

So many attempts... But eventually I got it!
<br>

<br>
<br>

Second pose! I always draw Sonic characters with the wrong proportions on purpose, then adjust them later. I don't know if this is the best way, but hey, it worked!
<br>

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e95a9ecc-37aa-4652-aba0-7cbdee74b3bc" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e843c97f-f98c-4633-b17b-53e261c23f62" />
<br>

<br>

And with that, I had the poses:

<br>

<img width="300" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1382972-5824-4268-98e5-4fa852be547e" />
<br>

Then what I had to do was find some animated backgrounds online and throw the images in a video editor. And here is the result:
<br>

![ltns-2 0-no-text-light](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80f33a27-9eee-4302-a3ff-10bbabaab501)
<br>

I really liked this one!

<br>
<br>

I was really struggling for more practice ideas, so I started drawing and trying to implement many elements at the same time:
<br>

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbcd8dbe-64d8-4057-80c1-81c4c8f5930e" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6977a856-be33-4f9e-893c-13a542624790" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b699e7d-ba4c-43ad-8ace-53b9757e7ea3" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60fa88c9-1ccb-403e-89c4-a18aed73e224" />

<br>
<br>

Not too bad, but the shading needed to be better. Next, I wanted to make another GIF:
<br>

![hippo](https://media1.tenor.com/m/AdaSVzqCxLIAAAAC/yugioh-anime.gif)
<br>

This time, one of my all-time favorite reaction GIFs. And I wanted to put Nova, my OC, in it.
<br>

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38cf1d0a-1645-46fb-8e48-c459089b4036" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a8b52a4-516f-464b-bc0d-b51f64ff194f" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70b6f969-d2e1-430f-9829-6fb561b7a871" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/079b6291-ae27-490c-a98d-2061f93dd04a" />

<br>

It was at this point that I started to notice: Damn, Nova is really starting to look cool in my drawings! This feeling is always so good!

<br>

When I was done with the GIF, I felt so happy! I still use it as a sticker to this day.
<br>

![ezgif-1486ac3455838c](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be262dc4-da79-4a64-82ef-a38a9d53e03d)

<br>

### Comparison (April vs July)

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef9f421b-171e-4d6f-aa9b-dbd58572e4ad" />

<br>

Every time I see these two side by side, I smile. Just imagine how it will be in a few more months!

<br>
<br>

During the rest of July, I spent time on a birthday drawing for a friend. It was during this month that I also changed a few settings in Clip Studio that really helped me out.
<br>

<img width="500" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2541a6e9-7b12-4e92-bb84-0ca1b2ef9746" />
<br>

I also used this time to learn some color theory. Not a lot, but I was able to learn a bit about hue shifting and not relying too much on the multiply layer.
<br>

<img width="200" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26ee2af7-33e0-4356-badb-9a9ac228371e" />

<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>

## More Color! (August 2025)

To be honest, it was this month that I stopped following the practice schedule almost entirely. I probably shouldn't have done that. On a more positive note, though, I made some more drawings during that time.
<br>

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0711d84d-17ab-438f-81fd-604467fe3afa" />

<br>
<br>

I also tried to paint this:

<br>

<img width="200" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0a84606-a2cb-4a56-b7f1-148fd33db86c" />
<img width="200" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac36a221-bc10-4033-902d-2262339d4d04" />

Emphasis on *try*.

<br>
<br>

I also started to think a little more about Nova's design. I wanted to change it.
<br>

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbceee04-8f85-4dc5-8070-6ff1b34626bd" />

I ended up making this:
<br>

<img width="400" height="646" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d331982f-4fa2-4cb6-9a45-26258736e036" />

Not too bad, but I noticed some issues with the drawing itself.

<br>
<br>

After this drawing, I realized I needed to improve on constructing the bodies of my characters better, so I started practicing the construction of Sonic characters.
<br>

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4552e52-f9dd-46a6-9d38-dd2d270fc100" />

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67ba8736-8f59-427f-8b9e-9729d87c347d" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa983c89-d5f2-474a-97b2-60f535eb2f4c" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f52d3f74-8110-4668-8620-985b0f45112c" />

<br>

This actually really helped me pose characters a little better!
<br>

Cute!
<br>

<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/990b29bf-cf74-4b69-b2bd-51d1211565b7" />

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Eyes! (September 2025)

In September I watched this cute anime:
<br>

<img width="400" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/879ba083-81c3-4063-87c4-c9d2ba2b6c4c" />
<br>

Something that caught my attention was the way the characters' eyes were drawn. I really liked it!
<br>

So I looked at them closely and decided to incorporate this style into my drawings.
<br>

Nova looks so cute with her eyes like this!
<br>

<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c645c4f6-b58c-4103-bb9b-6cd929eedb93" />
<br>

<br>
<br>

In September I also started my first comic-related challenge (about time!)
<br>

I decided to try redrawing an Archie Comics page that I didn't like the style of:
<br>

<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aeaa63b6-64ed-4ee4-b42e-f863db8a0187" />
<br>

I started making it in the same structure:
<br>

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f633d50e-6f0e-435a-8cf5-3c8dc986f76e" />

<br>

<br>
The final result:
<br>

<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d2293f4-3c36-4ec3-8e8c-2f296ad723e7" />
<br>

This was way harder than I expected! And that's good! I felt some improvement and learned something new!
<br>

<br>
I got so excited that I even sketched out a scene from the fanfic I was writing!
<br>

<img width="516" height="725" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b09022b-7624-4afe-803d-f2ed5e7dc418" />

## The Fanart Contest (October 2025)

This month was so crazy! I joined the official SEGA Discord server and ended up making some friends there. Then Sonic Racing Crossworlds released at the end of September, and at the start of October, the server admins came up with a fanart contest!
<br>

<img width="732" height="445" alt="{9B090C10-7D61-4AEB-AA4C-F411E278F4AA}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70aa1060-7d5c-4053-8c6e-40c8d1f78163" />
<br>

<br>
I usually don't take part in this kind of stuff. I'm too shy, but I love Sonic so much, and I was enjoying Crossworlds a lot! So I said, "Ah, fuck it" and joined. I wanted to make a drawing of my main in the game: Wave.

<br>
<img width="288" height="288" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97cbbcf6-016f-44ad-93dd-2206521b5272" />

<br>
So I got to work! I had a clear idea of her making a drift at E-Stadium, my favorite track.
<br>

I found a cool surfing reference pose and got into it!
<br>

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/586c901d-9fa5-4ba6-8d41-8a841e676295" />

<br>

I put a lot of effort into it and used absolutely everything I had learned from the past months. I really tried with this!
<br>

But most importantly, I was having so much fun drawing one of my favorite characters that I almost forgot about the contest!
<br>

<br>

### Wave Crossworlds!

I did my best with this and was happy. And as if that wasn't enough, BOOM.
<br>
