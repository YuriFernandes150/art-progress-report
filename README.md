# Spirik's Art Corner
This is my little art progress report readme! This is where I will  properly document my learning journey.

## In the beginning... (2024)
I just bought a drawing tablet, and started using Krita, A Few of the arts of then:

While still on Krita, I actually tried to use references and tried my best to adapt some sketches:

After that, I tried to color the drawings:

And then i bough Clipstudio Paint, and it really made a difference for me! It was so much easier to draw on it!

Still, the drawings were not very good.

## The (almost) daily practice era (April 2025)
at around April, I really decided to start to draw. I got inspired by such a bunch of things! The first drawing I made was themed around The Finals:

<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/398ddef0-2430-40c8-94da-9be16f777c91" />

This drawing was the turning point, I think, because after this, I really only thought and anticipated the next time I wuld be able to draw.

Then, I started researching some stuff, but very lightly, and got inspired to make a simple Sonic fan comic, these are my first atempts to draw an Original Character for the comic.

I love drawing this little bird, lol.


then I started light practice around parts of the body, though I dropped it pretty quickly...

Then I started to obsess over proper perspective, I started studying [Dom Ho Kim's Space Drawing Perspective](https://pt.scribd.com/document/863084480/Dong-Ho-Kim-Space-Drawing-Perspective), and It made me stasrte becoming more aware of the perspective on my drawings.

To draw backgrounds, I also got a lot of help from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZxvrzDyRa8). Who knew turning a layer blue made such a huge difference!
