# Spirik's Art Corner
This is my little art progress report readme! This is where I will  properly document my learning journey.

## In the beginning... (2024)
I just bought a drawing tablet, and started using Krita, A Few of the arts of then:

While still on Krita, I actually tried to use references and tried my best to adapt some sketches:

<img width="500" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b947c9a-2d29-4943-95b3-dfe0d3f3d1db" />
<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/388e2971-9f80-4ee6-b2c1-110b56d0ef9b" />

After that, I tried to color the drawings:

<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd34d3c9-f4cd-45e2-bc14-587614370ec8" />

And then i bough Clipstudio Paint, and it really made a difference for me! It was so much easier to draw on it!

<img width="100" height="180" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eea58c0a-340f-4257-b3c0-a388f41c1c91" />

Still, the drawings were not very good.

## The (almost) daily practice era (April 2025)
at around April, I really decided to start to draw. I got inspired by such a bunch of things! The first drawing I made was themed around The Finals:

<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/398ddef0-2430-40c8-94da-9be16f777c91" />

This drawing was the turning point, I think, because after this, I really only thought and anticipated the next time I wuld be able to draw.

Then, I started researching some stuff, but very lightly, and got inspired to make a simple Sonic fan comic, these are my first atempts to draw an Original Character for the comic.

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ca6c71d-f4dc-4d6e-9e6b-2ee874907a18" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/679dddfd-8a9d-4a9c-a71a-d37710c1b9cc" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33321c69-5076-48a9-a03b-5accecde276e" />

I love drawing this little bird, lol.


then I started light practice around parts of the body, though I dropped it pretty quickly...
<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dca899d4-5f84-4694-abbb-3862d1f01e11" />


Then I started to obsess over proper perspective, I started studying [Dom Ho Kim's Space Drawing Perspective](https://pt.scribd.com/document/863084480/Dong-Ho-Kim-Space-Drawing-Perspective), and It made me stasrte becoming more aware of the perspective on my drawings.

To draw backgrounds, I also got a lot of help from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZxvrzDyRa8). Who knew turning a layer blue made such a huge difference!

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00c83f76-eb49-4275-a0e3-9fb206b4d5d8" />

This is when I noticed some improvements in my lines! Look at this cute drawing! (her name is Nova)

<img width="500" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/658fee96-47bd-4e49-a89b-78c09a1d351a" />



Then, I started looking at some siple expressions reference. Can't do a comic without cool facial expressions, right? So i based myself on sonic references. These tow had been my most used for expressions since then:

<img width="300" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/822feee2-cd1f-46b2-9c05-6b827bc7ab7a" />
<img width="300" height="150" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4041e94-4bf3-49b5-8fb4-8a67e056f58b" />

I also picked some handy bird references for Nova. I really liked some angles for Wave in the Sonic comic, so I decided to use her as a reference, since I still have a lt of trouble drawing the mouth movements and expressions of characters with beaks.

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84b6d6eb-9c85-412f-8189-e290dc4bac88" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/528d10b7-8370-4dbf-8109-70b26496b1e4" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c03a1a5-310b-41c5-8173-ca394777b90d" />

quick note: This image is hillarious and I keep laughingg at it to this day:

<img width="300" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a33a986-9fd9-4976-9dc4-4e22648bbfe0" />



Anyway, here are the atempts I made using the Wave references!

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b0fd66f-6092-4316-a464-e80e64e8bddb" />

by this point I already noticed some improvement with drawing faces of Sonic characters.

<img width="100" height="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6aba058-464c-4cb9-b490-2874f33efcc8" />

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f4bf413-cfe5-4d28-91f9-896282d77bbe" />

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df3cc3eb-6209-410d-aa30-9eeb1bb69b4f" />


hey I was even able to draw twoe characters interacting! (which at this point I thought would be impossible for me lol).

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b5d8ce9-dde3-429a-9e91-d76bd4fa04ec" />


At this point, I tried drawing a goofy, expressive and moving drawing. I was the first time I actually tried something like that in digital. This kind of goofy, happy, cartoony feel to a drawing is what I actually want my art to be, to be honest:

<img width="200" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3de9e229-e29d-45c1-81cd-e8aefd542b4b" />
<img width="200" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab34f595-11b1-4eb0-8309-9c56779c08ba" />
<img width="200" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2073c81c-e5f1-4766-a4dc-2180e0c3bdea" />

Pretty cool! I still like this drawing, even if I notice the problems with it, isn't that the best part, though? Noticing your mistakes and figuring out how to correct them next time!

what really inspired me to draw like this, was [Keith Webb's](https://x.com/webbstawebb) artstyle:

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a7c4ec1-b9f8-492a-b415-ce0b2e7e6515" />
<img width="350" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/059b09f7-45d2-4c6a-99ee-68ecba020ac3" />

But then I noticed: My shading is too weak! I wanted a cartoony style, bu I also wanted to do nice light and shadows!
here's a [cool video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoUA8U0xxSY) that really helped my during the initial steps.

## Trying to setup a schedule (May 2025)
When May arrived, I was feeling more motivated and wanting to actually practice. So I organized an entire 1 year shcedule for my practice sessions:

<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c3fd327-90e3-4391-b1d2-2f7dddd6d0f3" />
<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/991ac977-1712-465c-9ca9-4c04b565e935" />
<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef524b06-9fdd-4a9a-abd6-9da0fa473e82" />
<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15da2cfe-dd8f-42e2-80ed-d1dceb1d00d2" />

I went ultra organized, but I was having a lot of trouble actually following up this schedule.
But oh well.

After setting it all up, i started practicing some poses adn expressions for Sonic:

<img width="400" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5343fe6b-1c08-4a07-9bae-350498dba1a1" />

For perspective practice, I actually found out that I could make rooms in perspective by making a plane from abovem and stretching it across the floor in perspective! It really helped me figure some stuff out.

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fc9c91c-d96c-4b75-86d3-de6c87afb2f2" />

There were some really interesting experiments I did too, mixing perspective, posing, etc:

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bedab098-291b-4be5-a12e-d1332395730d" />

for backgrounds, I had trouble pinning out the perspective. I didn't just wanted to cpy a background, i wanted to study it, and figure it out!
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60839a6f-cc61-4f99-8e8a-a45ad28dd378" />

When I have trouble with backgrounds, and finding its perspective, I tend to look at these 3 pics I took:

<img width="400" height="186" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c27b07cd-7e05-4d0c-b6ad-30d2c78d0a99" />
<img width="400" height="186" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7c57c50-4ee3-42c4-8589-1ccafa6a0d5f" />
<img width="400" height="186" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6aea6240-25e6-4c13-92b4-1abf8a02b0bf" />

These represent 1 point, 2 point, and 3 point perspectives taken from the same exact position!

Another thing I discovered in this month about perspective: IT'S ALL BOXES! EVERYYTHING FITS IN A BOX! ITS ABSOLUTELY INSANE!

<img width="200" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f7e501a-5748-4bfe-9f95-8ca8ebf4b802" />
<img width="200" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/394c583f-f123-4489-806f-6c575665b5d5" />


<img width="600" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/888eec82-fd63-4a7e-8936-d20eccadc5b5" />


Now armed with this wisdom from the heavens, I set to try it myself!

<img width="200" height="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05241a15-666f-411f-899b-3645c43bac62" />

At this point, I decided to aslo try a little change in my way of doing lineart. I always loved very think lines, so I decided to give it a go!

<img width="200" height="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ed559ed-7284-4d77-b57d-f6b59be1b6c6" />

To be Honest, I was really starting to like what I drew by this point. It's not nearly as professional or overall appealing to most ppl, but for me? I oloved it. And from then on, I really focused on my think lineart for future pieces.

<img width="300" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3863af81-7bde-4714-b82e-99ae8ca1b07d" />


I even started applying it to previous drawings:

<img width="800" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3178e6c-9835-4670-bfb1-bd156fd090db" />


## Visible improvements (June 2025)
Here are some more pracctice drawings from that time. I really like how my lineart improved since the first few ones!

<img width="200" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4dbd4dd-25f5-4df8-b0a4-c194ec87979a" />

At this point, I had trouble drawing the character's feet and shoes, so the boxes really helped me again! though many failed atempts were required...

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b17bb66-ad50-4611-9899-d753d6773574" />

and the winner is:

<img width="300" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c169a6a-1b04-4532-b0bf-d5e96ba7779e" />


After that, I did make a few more drawings there the shoes and feet seemed more correct!

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ef4ccf8-6018-4e06-aeed-25d577b61095" />

And them I started to have fun! I made some stickers for me to use for my discord!

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22be80eb-1737-4b00-ad93-682b3b1a22a1" />


And because of the stickers, some people ecven came to me to ask me to draw their OCs. I was a bit shocked, to be honest:

### Clef's OC: Ace

After all those fun times, I started to try drawing from imagination more. So I made this Sonic drawing, and , to be honest, I absolutely adore it to this day:

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8da74bf3-9439-4e0f-b2d2-221dd5623ccf" />

Here is another one (Boxes!)

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93db508d-a8a0-4cff-8b07-2018fb1c624c" />

Also I made one of my funniest drawings at this time:

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3efe33f2-1bd5-42ab-b5ab-7e884175877a" />

I also took this oportuniy to practice that shading!

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e82cdcb-d3b7-4972-89e0-132ac1d715c8" />

not my best atempt, tbh. But hey, in mistakes we learn!

## Animation! (July 2025) 

I always wanted to try some animations, even if simple, so I decided to challenge myself and make a little gif!

it all starts at the sketch, though. I wanted to replicate this high-five gif:

![hippo](https://media1.tenor.com/m/otKA66ctn9YAAAAd/scout-and-jester-dap-up-scout-and-jester.gif)

well, it was a simple enough gif, right? 2 frames and some movement! I can do it! (right?)

<img width="200" height="350" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b6a593f-b9b4-400d-9787-83aee5230712" />
<img width="200" height="350" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aebd648d-cee3-4e3c-beb8-11fe3baa4b3f" />

Now, something I do a lot is fix the drawing! Holy... how many times did I have to fix to get the face right....

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df688ef0-1b62-4897-ae21-fd460fb8f7b9" />

So many atempts... But eventually I got it lol.

Sconnd pose! I alsways draw Sonic characters with the wrong proportions on purpose, and then adjust them later. I dont know if this is the best way, but hey, it worked!

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e95a9ecc-37aa-4652-aba0-7cbdee74b3bc" />

And with that, I had the poses!

<img width="300" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1382972-5824-4268-98e5-4fa852be547e" />

and then What I had to do was find some animated backgrounds online, and throw theimagesn in a video editor. Ang here is the result:

![ltns-2 0-no-text-light](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80f33a27-9eee-4302-a3ff-10bbabaab501)


I really liked this one!

 I really was struggling for more practice Ideas, so I started drawing and trying to implement many elements at the same time.

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbcd8dbe-64d8-4057-80c1-81c4c8f5930e" />

Not too bad, but the shading needed to be better. The next thing I wanted to make, was another gif:

![hippo](https://media1.tenor.com/m/AdaSVzqCxLIAAAAC/yugioh-anime.gif)

This time, one of my all time favorite reaction gifs. And I wanted to put Nova, my OC, in it.

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38cf1d0a-1645-46fb-8e48-c459089b4036" />

It was at this point that I started to take some notice:  Damn... Nova is relly stating to look cool in my drawings! This feeling is always so good!

When I was done with the gif, I felt so happy! I still ise it as a sticker to this day.

![ezgif-1486ac3455838c](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be262dc4-da79-4a64-82ef-a38a9d53e03d)

## Comparison (April VS July)
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef9f421b-171e-4d6f-aa9b-dbd58572e4ad" />

Everytime I see these two side by side, I smile. Just imagine how it will be in a few more months!

during the rest of july, I spent some time on a little birthday drawing for a friend. I was during this month too, that  changed a few settings on clipstudio that really helped me out.

<img width="500" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2541a6e9-7b12-4e92-bb84-0ca1b2ef9746" />

I also used this time to learn some color theory stuff. Not a lot, but  I was able to learn a bit about hue shifting and not relying too much on the multiply layer.

## More color! (August 2025)
 To be honest, it was at this month that I stopped following the practice schecudle almost entirely.
 
 I probably shouldn't have done that. In a more positive note, though, I made some more drawings during that time.

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0711d84d-17ab-438f-81fd-604467fe3afa" />

I also tried to paint this:

<img width="200" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0a84606-a2cb-4a56-b7f1-148fd33db86c" />

Emphasis on *try*.

I also statrted to think a little bit mor on Nova's design, I wanted to change it.

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbceee04-8f85-4dc5-8070-6ff1b34626bd" />

I ended up making this:

<img width="400" height="646" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d331982f-4fa2-4cb6-9a45-26258736e036" />

not too bad, but I noticed some bad things on the drawing itself.


After this ddrawing, I noticed that I needed to improve on constructing the bodies of my characters better, so I started practicing the construction of Sonic characters.

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4552e52-f9dd-46a6-9d38-dd2d270fc100" />

This actually really helped me posing character a little better!

Cute!

## Eyes! (September 2025)

I semtember I watched this cute anime:

<img width="400" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/879ba083-81c3-4063-87c4-c9d2ba2b6c4c" />

And something that caught my attention was the way the characters eyes were drawn I really really liked it!

So I looked at them with attention and decided to incorporate it i my drawings.

Nova looks so cute with her eyes like this!

<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c645c4f6-b58c-4103-bb9b-6cd929eedb93" />


In september I also started my first comic related challenge (about time!)
I decided to tr redrawing an archie comics page that i didnt like the style of:

<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aeaa63b6-64ed-4ee4-b42e-f863db8a0187" />

I  started to make it in the same structure:

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f633d50e-6f0e-435a-8cf5-3c8dc986f76e" />

The final result:

This was way harder than I expected! And thats good! I felt some improvement, and learned something new!

I got so excited, that I even sketched out a scene from the fanfic I was writting!

## The fanart contest (October 2025)

This month was so crazy! I joined the official SEGA discord server, and ended up making some friends there. Then Sonic Racing Crossworlds released at the end of September, and at the start of October, the server admins came up with a fanart contest!

<img width="732" height="445" alt="{9B090C10-7D61-4AEB-AA4C-F411E278F4AA}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70aa1060-7d5c-4053-8c6e-40c8d1f78163" />

I usually dont take part in this kind of stuff. I'm too shy, but I love SOnic so much, and I was enjoying Crossworlds a lot! So I said, "Ah fuck it" and joined. I wanted to make a drawing of my main in the game: Wave.

<img width="288" height="288" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97cbbcf6-016f-44ad-93dd-2206521b5272" />

So I got to work! I had a clear idea of her making a drift at E-Stadium, my favorite track.

I got a cool surfing refference pose and got into it!

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/586c901d-9fa5-4ba6-8d41-8a841e676295" />

I put a lot of effort into it, and used absolutely verything I had learned from the past months. I really tried with this!
But most importantly at all, I was having so much fun, drawing one of my favorite characters, that I almost forgot about the contest lmao.


### Wave Crossworlds!
<img width="500" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/363776ea-1ae6-4d6b-82e3-6c78229c3b09" />

### Timelapse:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aad28198-4ab2-4b28-9200-df133143eb87

I did my best with this, and was happy. And as if that wasn't enough, BOOM.

<img width="701" height="264" alt="{AB6E2E3B-9B86-4D4E-920A-E0A43A647E51}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d527cb59-6354-477a-964e-1aa574fbdd8b" />

I had won the contest! That felt unreal! It was hard to believe, but it did feel great having some validation.

## The Future
Is always uncertain, but I want to keep drawing. I want to get better, i can't wait to see where I'll be in the next months!
