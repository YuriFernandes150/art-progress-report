# Spirik's Art Corner
This is my little art progress report readme! This is where I will  properly document my learning journey.

## In the beginning... (2024)
I just bought a drawing tablet, and started using Krita, A Few of the arts of then:

While still on Krita, I actually tried to use references and tried my best to adapt some sketches:

<img width="500" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b947c9a-2d29-4943-95b3-dfe0d3f3d1db" />

After that, I tried to color the drawings:

And then i bough Clipstudio Paint, and it really made a difference for me! It was so much easier to draw on it!

<img width="100" height="180" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eea58c0a-340f-4257-b3c0-a388f41c1c91" />

Still, the drawings were not very good.

## The (almost) daily practice era (April 2025)
at around April, I really decided to start to draw. I got inspired by such a bunch of things! The first drawing I made was themed around The Finals:

<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/398ddef0-2430-40c8-94da-9be16f777c91" />

This drawing was the turning point, I think, because after this, I really only thought and anticipated the next time I wuld be able to draw.

Then, I started researching some stuff, but very lightly, and got inspired to make a simple Sonic fan comic, these are my first atempts to draw an Original Character for the comic.

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/679dddfd-8a9d-4a9c-a71a-d37710c1b9cc" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33321c69-5076-48a9-a03b-5accecde276e" />

I love drawing this little bird, lol.


then I started light practice around parts of the body, though I dropped it pretty quickly...
<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dca899d4-5f84-4694-abbb-3862d1f01e11" />


Then I started to obsess over proper perspective, I started studying [Dom Ho Kim's Space Drawing Perspective](https://pt.scribd.com/document/863084480/Dong-Ho-Kim-Space-Drawing-Perspective), and It made me stasrte becoming more aware of the perspective on my drawings.

To draw backgrounds, I also got a lot of help from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZxvrzDyRa8). Who knew turning a layer blue made such a huge difference!

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00c83f76-eb49-4275-a0e3-9fb206b4d5d8" />

This is when I noticed some improvements in my lines! Look at this cute drawing! (her name is Nova)

<img width="500" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/658fee96-47bd-4e49-a89b-78c09a1d351a" />



Then, I started looking at some siple expressions reference. Can't do a comic without cool facial expressions, right? So i based myself on sonic references. These tow had been my most used for expressions since then:

<img width="300" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/822feee2-cd1f-46b2-9c05-6b827bc7ab7a" />
<img width="300" height="150" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4041e94-4bf3-49b5-8fb4-8a67e056f58b" />

I also picked some handy bird references for Nova. I really liked some angles for Wave in the Sonic comic, so I decided to use her as a reference, since I still have a lt of trouble drawing the mouth movements and expressions of characters with beaks.

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84b6d6eb-9c85-412f-8189-e290dc4bac88" />
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/528d10b7-8370-4dbf-8109-70b26496b1e4" />

quick note: This image is hillarious and I keep laughingg at it to this day:

<img width="300" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a33a986-9fd9-4976-9dc4-4e22648bbfe0" />



Anyway, here are the atempts I made using the Wave references!

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b0fd66f-6092-4316-a464-e80e64e8bddb" />

by this point I already noticed some improvement with drawing faces of Sonic characters.

<img width="100" height="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6aba058-464c-4cb9-b490-2874f33efcc8" />

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df3cc3eb-6209-410d-aa30-9eeb1bb69b4f" />


hey I was even able to draw twoe characters interacting! (which at this point I thought would be impossible for me lol).

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b5d8ce9-dde3-429a-9e91-d76bd4fa04ec" />


At this point, I tried drawing a goofy, expressive and moving drawing. I was the first time I actually tried something like that in digital. This kind of goofy, happy, cartoony feel to a drawing is what I actually want my art to be, to be honest:

<img width="200" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3de9e229-e29d-45c1-81cd-e8aefd542b4b" />
<img width="200" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab34f595-11b1-4eb0-8309-9c56779c08ba" />
<img width="200" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2073c81c-e5f1-4766-a4dc-2180e0c3bdea" />

Pretty cool! I still like this drawing, even if I notice the problems with it, isn't that the best part, though? Noticing your mistakes and figuring out how to correct them next time!

what really inspired me to draw like this, was [Keith Webb's](https://x.com/webbstawebb) artstyle:

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a7c4ec1-b9f8-492a-b415-ce0b2e7e6515" />
<img width="350" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/059b09f7-45d2-4c6a-99ee-68ecba020ac3" />

But then I noticed: My shading is too weak! I wanted a cartoony style, bu I also wanted to do nice light and shadows!
here's a [cool video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoUA8U0xxSY) that really helped my during the initial steps.

## Trying to setup a schedule (May 2025)
When May arrived, I was feeling more motivated and wanting to actually practice. So I organized an entire 1 year shcedule for my practice sessions:

<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c3fd327-90e3-4391-b1d2-2f7dddd6d0f3" />

<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef524b06-9fdd-4a9a-abd6-9da0fa473e82" />
<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15da2cfe-dd8f-42e2-80ed-d1dceb1d00d2" />

I went ultra organized, but I was having a lot of trouble actually following up this schedule.
But oh well.

After setting it all up, i started practicing some poses adn expressions for Sonic:

<img width="400" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5343fe6b-1c08-4a07-9bae-350498dba1a1" />

For perspective practice, I actually found out that I could make rooms in perspective by making a plane from abovem and stretching it across the floor in perspective! It really helped me figure some stuff out.

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fc9c91c-d96c-4b75-86d3-de6c87afb2f2" />

There were some really interesting experiments I did too, mixing perspective, posing, etc:

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bedab098-291b-4be5-a12e-d1332395730d" />

for backgrounds, I had trouble pinning out the perspective. I didn't just wanted to cpy a background, i wanted to study it, and figure it out!
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60839a6f-cc61-4f99-8e8a-a45ad28dd378" />

When I have trouble with backgrounds, and finding its perspective, I tend to look at these 3 pics I took:

<img width="400" height="186" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c27b07cd-7e05-4d0c-b6ad-30d2c78d0a99" />
<img width="400" height="186" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7c57c50-4ee3-42c4-8589-1ccafa6a0d5f" />
<img width="400" height="186" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6aea6240-25e6-4c13-92b4-1abf8a02b0bf" />

These represent 1 point, 2 point, and 3 point perspectives taken from the same exact position!

Another thing I discovered in this month about perspective: IT'S ALL BOXES! EVERYYTHING FITS IN A BOX! ITS ABSOLUTELY INSANE!

<img width="200" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f7e501a-5748-4bfe-9f95-8ca8ebf4b802" />

<img width="600" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/888eec82-fd63-4a7e-8936-d20eccadc5b5" />


now armed with this wisdom from the heavens, I set to try it myself!

<img width="200" height="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05241a15-666f-411f-899b-3645c43bac62" />

at this point, I decided to aslo try a little change in my way of doing lineart. I always loved very think lines, so I decided to give it a go!

<img width="200" height="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ed559ed-7284-4d77-b57d-f6b59be1b6c6" />

To be Honest, I was really starting to like what I drew by this point. It's not nearly as professional or overall appealing to most ppl, but for me? I oloved it. And from then on, I really focused on my think lineart for future pieces.

<img width="300" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3863af81-7bde-4714-b82e-99ae8ca1b07d" />


I even started applying it to previous drawings:

<img width="800" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3178e6c-9835-4670-bfb1-bd156fd090db" />


Here are some more pracctice drawings from that time. I really like how my lineart improved since the first few ones!

<img width="200" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4dbd4dd-25f5-4df8-b0a4-c194ec87979a" />

At this point, I had trouble drawing the character's feet and shoes, so the boxes really helped me again! though many failed atempts were required...

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b17bb66-ad50-4611-9899-d753d6773574" />

and the winner is:

<img width="300" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c169a6a-1b04-4532-b0bf-d5e96ba7779e" />


After that, I did make a few more drawings there the shoes and feet seemed more correct!

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ef4ccf8-6018-4e06-aeed-25d577b61095" />
